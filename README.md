### Hi! I am George Jordan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist. 

My GitHub profile is a place where I can showcase some personal projects, share code for the tutorials and other publications I've written, and generally do GitHub type things.

I would appreciate some ideas of collaboration, or discussions about working together on some projects.

Don't hesitate to drop me a line if you have any questions.
